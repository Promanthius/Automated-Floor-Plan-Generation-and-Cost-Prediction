# Automated Floor Plan Generation and Cost Prediction Using AI-Based Modeling

This repository contains all research and development files for the thesis project **"Automated Floor Plan Generation and Cost Prediction Using AI-Based Modeling for Residential Construction"**.  

The project aims to develop a prototype system that can scan/import floor plans, generate editable layouts, and provide automated construction cost estimations. It combines **AI-based modeling, data analysis, and Unity-based application development**.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **App/**  
  Unity project files for the desktop application.  

- **Data/**  
  Holds datasets used for AI model training and testing (e.g., floor plans, cost references).

- **Docs/**  
  Contains thesis-related documents (proposal, ethics forms, appendices, drafts, etc.).

- **Model/**  
  Contains code and experiments for machine learning models.

---

## 🚀 Current Progress
- Thesis documents prepared and organized.
- Initial dataset collection from public sources and Kaggle.
- AI model design planned (GAN + Regression + Constraint-based algorithm).
- Unity app framework being set up (not yet executable).

## 🔧 Requirements
Depending on which part of the project you want to explore:  

- **Docs** → Any text/PDF editor  
- **Data** → Python, Jupyter Notebook (optional)  
- **Model** → Python 3.x, TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, scikit-learn  
- **App** → Unity Hub + Unity Editor (2022 or later recommended) Optional: Unity ML-Agents Toolkit (if AI logic is integrated directly in Unity instead of Python)

⚠️ Note: If the entire AI logic and system are implemented in Unity only, you don’t need Python, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. Everything can be done with Unity C# scripts, plugins, and ML-Agents.
